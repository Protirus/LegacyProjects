## App Store

Protirus App Store is an endpoint client residing in the user’s task tray, with an intuitive interface allowing a user to view installed software, post requests for new installs, track progress of requests, update existing software and remove or re-install existing software. An administrator is able to publish available software, and Workflow integration supports custom approval processes.

## Edition Patrol

> Protirus Edition Patrol tells you exactly which instances of your premium software are being used to simply view or read files, allowing an administrator to consider replacing it with the vendors free “reader” alternative.

## Power Governance

> Power Governance solves this problem by closing applications, saving work, and informing both the administrator and the end user where they can locate their previously unsaved work.

## Service Fulfilment

> Protirus Service Fulfilment combines Symantec’s Asset Management Suite and Workflow with a toolset that enables the administrator to configure rather than develop your service fulfilment process.

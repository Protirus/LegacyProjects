> Sailing towards a brighter future

> “Service Fulfilment was developed in collaboration with a large construction, development and service group in the UK.”

Protirus Service Fulfilment combines Symantec’s Asset Management Suite and Workflow with a toolset that enables the administrator to configure rather than develop your service fulfilment process.

## Features
- Financial forecasting, business re-charge tool
- Workflow configuration tool
- Enterprise asset management tool
- Granular and roll up SLA tracking
- Full integration with Service Desk

**Configurable out of the box processes include:**

- Starters and leavers process
- Self service request portal including:
  - Automated software delivery
  - Software license purchasing
  - Service catalogue requests
  - Lost and stolen
  - Equipment requests
  - Access control request
  - Recycling of hardware and software requests
- Full asset lifecycle process

**Founded out of the requirement to manage the following type of questions in an easy to use solution:**

- How do I manage my starters and leavers process?
- How do I manage Service Fulfilment within the Service Desk?
- How do I link these with my Service Catalogue and make the whole solution self-serving?
- How does this fit into my asset lifecycle process?
- How does this fit in with my provisioning process?
- How do I recharge the business for IT services?
- I’m a service provider – how do I charge my customers for these services?

Using the Symantec Management Platform and Symantec Workflow our Workflow Delivery Team have been able to join these up with a continuously growing library of custom processes and dedicated Workflows.

**Service Fulfilment gives the user the ability to:**
- Leverage all of the power of the Symantec Management Platform
- Underpinned by CMDB and Workflow
- No need to learn Workflow – processes configured rather than customised
- Ability for the advanced user to break out of configured processes with extended custom automations
